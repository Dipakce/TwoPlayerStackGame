# TwoPlayerStackGame
Design a two players game of stack using C++ or Python as follows: two players are given n numbers as input and a stack to store these numbers. Initially, players push all input numbers into their respective stack. In each turn of the game, both players pop up a number from the stack. Let n1 and n2 be the popup numbers for player 1 and 2 respectively.
a.If n >n ,then (n −n ) number of elements from the stack of player 1 is popped and pushed into the stack of player 2.
b. If n >n ,then (n −n) number of elements from the stack of player 2 is popped and pushed into the stack of player 1.
c. If If n1 = n2 , then no action is taken and game proceeds to next turn.
